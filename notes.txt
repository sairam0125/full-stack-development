2.anonymous function:- function which doesnot have a name for declare.
        -anonmyous function cannot be executed immediately.
3.function expression:-function declaration is assigned as a value to the variable 
4.immediate invoke functions expressions:- once the function is created it should be executed immediately.
            -it can be executed once.
5.arrow function:- to conise the syntax of normal function.
syntax:- ()=>{}; similar to anonmyous function
6.higher order function:
    -higher order function is a function which accepts another function as value/argument to its parameter.
7.callback function:
        -callback function is a function which is passed as value/arguments to another function.

    -closure: closure is a memory created when functions bundled together/functions are nested each other by giving accessibility 
    to the inner most function to access the variables of outermost function.

    -closure is a memory which gives the accessibility to the variables of the outermost function.

note: current version of javascript: es14.

Return statement:- it will return either expression or variable to future use.

implicit return:- returns with the usage of return statement.
explicit return:- returns with out using return statement.

Arrays:-
--------------
- Array can store multiple values within a single varialbe.
-collections of items/values.
-array can store homogenous values and heterogenous values.

Syntax: []
examples:

map:- 

forEach:-

methods in array:-
********************
push(),pop(),unshift(),shift(),unshift(),concat(),reverse(),join().

what is an object:-
*********************
-object is an entity which is used to store values in the form of key & value pairs
-object is a physical entity which is is having states(properties) and behaviour(method)

Web storages
*****************

1.Local storage:- it is a permanent data storage.
                - it can store upto 10MB.
                methods:-

Asynchronous:- making javascript to work multiple work simultaneously

1.setTimeout() :- It is a web api used to perform Asynchronous operations in certain timeout.
    Syntax:- setTimeout(callbackfn, timeout);

2.setInterval():- It is a web api used to perform async operations form 
    Syntax:- setInterval(callbackfn, timeinterval);

3.promise (es6 feature):- It is an object which represents eventual completion or failures of asynchronous 

            states of promise:-
            1.Pending:- still on going.
            2.fulfilled:- successfully completed.
            3.rejected:-   failures

    Syntax:- new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{});

-for handling the promise we have a instance methods,
    1.then(): It is used to handle successful data.
    2.catch():- Used to handle errors.
    3.finally()

DOM:-document object model

Modules:-
**********

take array of objects each object should contain emp-id,emp-name,emp-company,emp-salary and emp-address, where emp address
is again an object which contains emp-city, emp-area. print all those values on the ui in the form of table.


libraries: it is a collection of codes.
            -less set of rules
            -react.js,jquery,ember etc....

            -these are used to develop small or modrate application like swiggy , zomato etc..

frameworks: it is a collection of libraries.
            -they have more set of rules.
            -angular,

 Modeules:
modules are like import/export code to another js files
REACT
**********************************************************************************************************************
what is reatjs?

-javascript is having libraries and frameworks.
-react is a javascript library to build rich user interface.
-react is faster because of "virtual DOM".
-react follows component based approach.
-react follows unidirectional data flow.
-react follows both clients-side rendering and server-side rendering.

Note:
-react was introduced in 2011 by facebook.(jordan walke)
-later it was made open-source in 2013.
-react is free and platform independent.

what is virtal DOM?
virtual DOM is a virtual representation of ui which is kept in a memory and later synced witnode h real dom by using 
library called "reactDOM"

what is reconcilation?

the process of updating the reactDOM with the virtual dom is called as reconcilation.

installing of react appliaction:

-install node js

-install react application CLI(command line interface)
-install
